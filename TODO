# This program is used to manage unix and samba account in an unified 
# fashion. It relies extensively on unix tools like useradd, userdel, 
# smbpasswd

# TODO : 
# * add an option to change user account password
#
# FIXME: 
# * If group membership is already build up with more than one group 
#   and only one is given after -m switch, script hangs...
# Solution : 
# * Get group membership and add it to result
